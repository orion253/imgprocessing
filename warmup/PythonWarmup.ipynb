    "\n",
    "_Python_ is a remarkably rich language, and there are multiple ways of achieving certain results. There is no way that we can spend longer going into the intricacies of _Python_: that would be totally unrealistic. Instead, I expect you to return to these notes as you need to recall how to structure certain control statements, and to get examples of list comprehension, and `numpy` syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that a key skill is to be able to figure out where to find the right information. The internet is a fabulous place for this, but it can also contain examples that refer to old versions of _Python_ libraries, or perhaps syntax that is obsolete (deprecated). Use caution and learn as best as possible to read the documentation and experiment with little code fragments to make sure you know what a command or function does. Also, make use of `type` and `dir` and `help` commands....\n"
